      <h2>Assalamu alaikum ya habibti</h2>
      <p>
        I made this little journey for you because you’ve been on my mind in the quiet moments,
        and I wanted you to feel it, not just read it.
        Take your time, scroll slowly, I built this like a story, page by page, heart to heart. 💛
      </p>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>I thank Allah for you</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes I genuinely sit there and think, Ya Allah how did I get someone like her.
        You’re not random in my life, you feel like a gift.
        And I never want to treat you like something normal, because you’re not.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>It started on Salams</h2>
      <p>
        We matched on Salams and I still remember you catching my eye immediately.
        Not just because you’re beautiful, but because you felt real.
        Like you weren’t trying to perform, you were just you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I’ll be honest, I didn’t even want to match with anyone else.
        Something in my heart was pulling me toward you,
        like Allah was quietly steering me in the right direction.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>At first, I had worries</h2>
      <p>
        In the beginning, I had thoughts in my head.
        Not because I saw you in a bad way, but because marriage is serious, and I’m not playing with someone’s heart.
        I didn’t want to be careless with you, and I didn’t want to be careless with myself either.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were honest with me about parts of your life, and I respected you for that.
        It made me pause in a serious way, not judgment.
        I was asking myself, can I be the man she deserves, and can I carry this with mercy, not ego.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>What made me stay anyway</h2>
      <p>
        Even with those thoughts, I couldn’t ignore how you made me feel when we talked.
        Your heart felt soft, your intentions felt clean.
        The more I learned you, the more I realized you weren’t asking for perfection,
        you were asking for sincerity.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why I stayed.
        Because you felt like someone I could build with the right way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>When it started feeling real</h2>
      <p>
        The moment you FaceTimed me, and I felt you actually taking me seriously,
        that’s when something shifted in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember thinking, okay, she’s not playing around.
        And that’s when I first started thinking you might actually be the one.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>December 18, 2025, the beginning</h2>
      <p>
        That day we first started talking, it didn’t feel like a random conversation.
        It felt like something was opening in my life,
        like Allah was writing a new chapter and letting me feel it as it started.
        I didn’t know how deep it would go yet, but it felt natural from the start.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>The days after</h2>
      <p>
        The more we talked, the more I caught myself smiling for no reason.
        I’d read your messages and my chest would genuinely feel warm.
        It wasn’t just attraction, it was peace.
        Like you were becoming a safe place for my heart.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>December 24, 2025, I said I love you</h2>
      <p>
        I still remember that moment clearly.
        It stopped being something I was just thinking, and it became something I knew.
        I said I love you and I meant it with sincerity, not for fun, not as a game.
        I meant it like I’m serious about you and I’m serious about your heart.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>And after that, I wrote you everywhere</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote about you so much, in my journal, in my thoughts, even in that letter to my future wife.
        And it always came back to the same thing.
        You made me want to do this the right way.
        You made me want halal love, clean love, love with barakah.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>January 9, 2026, the first time I met you</h2>
      <p>
        I met you in person for the first time and I had to stay calm on the outside,
        but inside I was honestly shocked by how beautiful and sweet you were.
        Your brother and your sister in law were there, so I stayed respectful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kept glancing at you when I thought your brother wouldn’t notice,
        not in a weird way, just in that quiet way where you can’t help but admire someone.
        And you thought I wasn’t into you because I didn’t speak much,
        but the truth is I was trying to do everything the right way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>That moment after dinner, I still remember it</h2>
      <p>
        When we were done eating and we walked back to our cars,
        and you gave me the gifts you prepared for me,
        I remember holding them and thinking, SubhanAllah she really did this for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I waited for you to get into your car and I didn’t want to leave.
        I just stood there wanting to stay in that moment a little longer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>And then you said it</h2>
      <p>
        You finally had the courage to speak and you hit me with your signature,
        Hiiiiiiiii.
      </p>
      <p>
        I smiled so hard.
        And I swear I couldn’t drive off until you all left the parking lot.
        I wanted to see you until I couldn’t anymore.
        That’s how I knew I was already attached, quietly, deeply, and for real.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>I liked you even more after that</h2>
      <p>
        Meeting you didn’t make things less real, it made it more real.
        I went home with my heart louder than before,
        like it was saying this is the person you’ve been praying for.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>January 14, 2026, you said I love you</h2>
      <p>
        When you said you love me for the first time, it hit me deep.
        It felt like something heavy became lighter.
        Like Allah gave me comfort that we’re walking toward each other,
        not just alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>What I feel</h2>
      <p>
        You make my heart feel safe.
        Even from far away, you bring me peace.
        When I hear your voice, it’s like my worries step back for a moment,
        and I remember what I’m working toward,
        a life with you that’s clean and blessed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>What I admire about you</h2>
      <p>
        I admire your softness and your strength.
        I admire your intentions.
        I admire the way you care with your whole heart.
        You’re the kind of person that makes me want to be better,
        not out of pressure, but out of love and respect.

      <h2>A dua for us</h2>
      <p>
        Ya Allah, put barakah in what we have.
        Protect it from envy, from misunderstandings, from distance,
        from anything that tries to shake it.
        Keep our hearts clean, keep our love halal,
        and guide us to a marriage that brings us closer to You. Ameen.

      <p>
        I’m excited for the day it becomes halal, when I can hold your hand without any fear,
        when I can call you my wife with Allah as our witness.
        I want a home with you that feels like sakinah,
        warmth, mercy, and peace.

      <h2>What I promise you</h2>
      <p>
        I promise to be gentle with your heart.
        I promise to listen, even when it’s hard,
        and to never turn your feelings into something small.
        I promise to respect you in private and in public.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I promise something important.
        I will never make you feel vulnerable.
        I will never put you in a position where you feel unprotected or unsafe with me.
        You deserve a man who makes you feel covered,
        emotionally, mentally, and in every way that matters.

        I’m grateful Allah wrote you into my life.
        And I keep making the same dua,
        that Allah keeps you safe, keeps you healthy, keeps your heart at ease,
        and makes the path for us smooth until we’re together the right way.

        Ya Allah, unite us in goodness.
        Put love and rahmah between us.
        Make us a comfort for each other in this dunya,
        and reunite us in Jannah. Ameen.

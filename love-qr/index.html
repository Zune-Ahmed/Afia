      <h2>Assalamu alaikum ya habibti</h2>
      <p>
        I made this little journey for you… because you’ve been on my mind in the quiet moments,
        and I wanted you to <em>feel</em> how much you mean to me.
        Scroll slowly — I built this like a story, one step at a time. 💛

      <h2>I thank Allah for sending you to me</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes I just sit there and think… “Ya Allah, how did I get someone like her?”
        You’re not random in my life. You’re a gift.
        And I never want to treat you like something ordinary, because you’re not.

    <!-- ✅ NEW: Salams + the first pull -->
    <section class="page">
      <h2>It started on Salams</h2>
      <p>
        We matched on Salams… and I still remember how you caught my eye immediately.
        Not just your looks — you felt real.
        Like you weren’t trying to impress anyone. Like you were just being you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I’m being honest… I didn’t match with anyone else.
        Something in my heart was telling me to talk to you.
        Like Allah was quietly pushing me toward you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>At first… I had thoughts and worries</h2>
      <p>
        In the beginning, I had questions in my head.
        Not because of you as a person — but because of how serious marriage is.
        I didn’t want to be careless with someone’s heart, and I didn’t want to be careless with my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were honest with me about parts of your life… and I respected that.
        It made me pause for a moment — not in judgment —
        but in that serious way where you think: “Can I be the man she deserves?”
        And “Can I carry this with mercy, not ego?”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>What made me stay anyway</h2>
      <p>
        Even with those thoughts… I couldn’t ignore what I felt when I spoke to you.
        Your heart felt soft. Your intentions felt clean.
        And the more I learned you, the more I realized:
        you weren’t asking for perfection — you were asking for sincerity.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why I stayed.
        Because you felt like someone I could build with the right way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>When it started feeling real</h2>
      <p>
        The moment you decided to FaceTime me…
        and I felt you actually taking me seriously…
        that’s when something shifted in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember thinking:
        “Okay… she’s not playing around.”
        And that’s when I first started thinking you might actually be the one.

    <!-- ✅ Timeline start -->
    <section class="page">
      <h2>December 18, 2025 — the beginning</h2>
      <p>
        That day we first started talking… and I swear, it didn’t feel like “just a conversation.”
        It felt like something was opening in my life — like Allah was quietly writing a new chapter for me.
        I didn’t know how deep it would go yet… but I remember how natural it felt.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>The days after…</h2>
      <p>
        The more we talked, the more I caught myself smiling for no reason.
        I’d read your messages and feel my chest get warm.
        It wasn’t just attraction — it was peace. Like you were becoming a safe place for my heart.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>December 24, 2025 — I said “I love you”</h2>
      <p>
        I still remember that feeling — that moment where it stopped being something I was “thinking”…
        and it became something I knew.
        I said I love you, and I meant it with sincerity, not for fun, not as a game.
        I meant it like a promise: that I will be serious with your heart.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>And after that… I wrote you everywhere</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote so much about you — in my journals, in my thoughts, in that letter to my future wife…
        and it kept coming back to the same thing:
        you made me want to do things the right way.
        You made me want halal love — clean love — love with barakah.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>January 9, 2026 — the first time I met you</h2>
      <p>
        I met you in person for the first time, and I remember how I had to stay calm on the outside…
        but inside, I was honestly shocked by how beautiful and sweet you were.
        Your brother and your sister-in-law were there, so I kept myself respectful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was glancing at you when I thought your brother wouldn’t notice — not in a bad way…
        just in that quiet way where you can’t help but admire someone.
        And you thought I wasn’t into you because I didn’t speak much…
        but the truth is: I was trying to do everything the right way.

    <!-- ✅ NEW: The parking lot moment + gifts + “Hiiiii” -->
    <section class="page">
      <h2>That moment after dinner… I still remember it</h2>
      <p>
        When we were done eating, we walked back to our cars.
        And you gave me the gifts you prepared for me.
        I remember holding them and thinking:
        “SubhanAllah… she really did this for me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I waited for you to get into your car, and I didn’t want to leave.
        I just stood there, wanting to stay in that moment a little longer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>And then you said it</h2>
      <p>
        You finally had the courage to speak and you hit me with your signature:
        “Hiiiiiiiii.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I smiled so hard.
        And I swear, I couldn’t drive off until you all left the parking lot.
        I wanted to see you until I couldn’t anymore.
        That’s how I knew I was already attached — quietly, deeply, and for real.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>I liked you even more after that</h2>
      <p>
        Meeting you didn’t make things “less real.”
        It made it more real.
        I went home with my heart louder than before — like it was saying:
        “This is the person you’ve been praying for.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>January 14, 2026 — you said “I love you”</h2>
      <p>
        When you said you love me for the first time…
        I’m not even exaggerating — it hit me deep.
        It felt like something heavy became lighter.
        Like Allah gave me a sign of comfort: that we’re walking toward each other, not just alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>What I feel</h2>
      <p>
        You make my heart feel safe. Even from far away, you bring me peace.
        When I hear your voice, it’s like my worries step back for a moment…
        and I remember what I’m working toward — a life with you that’s clean and blessed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>What I admire about you</h2>
      <p>
        I admire your softness and your strength.
        I admire your intentions.
        I admire the way you care with your whole heart.
        You’re the kind of person that makes me want to be better — not out of pressure,
        but out of love and respect.

      <h2>A dua for us</h2>

        Ya Allah, put barakah in what we have. Protect it from envy, from misunderstandings, from distance,

        that brings us closer to You. Ameen.
